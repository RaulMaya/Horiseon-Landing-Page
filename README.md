The objective of this project is to refactor, by using some good practices like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and the Scout Rule that states to always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it. Also review the semantic and structure of the HTML, elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning and the CSS Rules with comments.
